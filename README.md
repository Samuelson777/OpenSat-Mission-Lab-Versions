## Project Overview

OpenSat Mission Lab began as a home-PC CubeSat simulation project and evolved into a broad satellite mission engineering and operations environment.

The platform demonstrates how a mission system can be developed incrementally while retaining reproducible evidence for every major engineering layer. The complete release history covers:

- mission definition and configuration;
- orbital, eclipse, contact, and Earth-fixed geometry;
- electrical-power and battery simulation;
- attitude determination and control;
- RF link analysis and adaptive downlink;
- Earth-observation and geospatial processing;
- time-series fusion and data-cube management;
- service APIs, background workers, and tenant isolation;
- governance, security, audit, and disaster recovery;
- zero-trust workload identity and external policy decisions;
- software supply-chain security and signed release evidence;
- service-level objectives, observability, chaos testing, and rollback;
- distributed tracing, autoscaling, and capacity forecasting;
- multi-region active-active operation and data-sovereignty controls;
- replayable workflow orchestration with human approval gates;
- cryptographically signed approvals and safety-invariant checking.

The project is intentionally modular. Individual components can be studied separately, while the complete platform demonstrates how spacecraft, ground, data, software, security, governance, and human-operator concerns interact.

## Validation and Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Run the website validator:

```bash
python docs/validate_site.py
```

Compile the Python source:

```bash
python -m compileall -q src tests
```

Current verified project evidence includes:

| Validation area | Result |
|---|---:|
| Documented releases | 35 |
| Release range | v0.1.0–v3.1.0 |
| Application tests | 203 passed |
| GitHub Pages mission samples | 1,600 |
| Retained website dashboards | 18 |
| Safety-assurance controls | 28 of 28 passed |
| Signed approval records verified | 10 |
| Unsafe command attempts blocked | 5 |
| Workflow snapshots migrated | 3 |
| Command-gate states checked | 256 |
| Safety-invariant violations | 0 |

The 203 application tests were validated in isolated partitions in the integrated website release because a single long-running process encountered cumulative resource pressure late in the suite. All test groups passed.

## Security and Safety Boundaries

OpenSat Mission Lab includes security and safety engineering demonstrations, but several boundaries must remain explicit:

- deterministic signing keys are demonstration identities;
- simulated command authorization does not grant real operational authority;
- no real spacecraft commands are transmitted;
- policy and regional scenarios are educational inputs;
- simulated RTO, RPO, cost, latency, and carbon results are not cloud-provider guarantees;
- offline vulnerability fixtures are not a replacement for current advisory feeds;
- the PostgreSQL RLS harness requires a live disposable PostgreSQL environment for database-enforced validation;
- the safety-state model verifies the defined educational state space, not complete flight software;
- operational deployment would require independent verification and validation, secure key custody, legal review, mission-specific threat modelling, hazard analysis, and certification.

Security issues should be reported according to [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), not through a public issue containing sensitive details.

---

## Conclusion

OpenSat Mission Lab demonstrates how a home-computer-based open-source project can evolve into a comprehensive satellite mission engineering, operations, security, and governance platform.

From v0.1.0 through v3.1.0, the project progressively connects mission planning, orbital analysis, spacecraft subsystem simulation, Earth observation, geospatial processing, distributed services, zero-trust security, supply-chain protection, observability, multi-region resilience, policy governance, human approval, workflow replay, cryptographic authorization, and safety-invariant validation.

The project’s main strength is its evidence-driven development approach. Important capabilities are accompanied by automated tests, dashboards, plots, structured logs, traces, audit records, signed artifacts, policy evaluations, recovery exercises, and reproducible outputs. The retained release history shows engineering progression rather than presenting only a final software snapshot.

The GitHub Pages website makes the complete development history accessible as a technical portfolio. Visitors can explore all 35 releases, replay mission telemetry, inspect engineering layers, and review generated evidence without installing the Python application.

The project achieves its primary objective: demonstrating a broad combination of space engineering, software development, data science, security, DevOps, distributed systems, mission operations, and technical documentation skills using tools that can run on a personal computer.

OpenSat Mission Lab remains an educational and engineering simulator. Operational use would require independent verification, mission-specific infrastructure, formal safety engineering, regulatory assessment, secure key management, and appropriate certification.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Live public space-data integration

Connect maintained orbital catalogues, public Earth-observation products, weather information, geomagnetic data, and community ground-station observations while retaining deterministic offline fixtures.

### 2. Higher-fidelity astrodynamics

Add numerical propagation with atmospheric drag, Earth oblateness, solar-radiation pressure, manoeuvre design, conjunction analysis, uncertainty propagation, and covariance handling.

### 3. Expanded spacecraft digital twin

Model thermal behaviour, reaction-wheel momentum, magnetic torquers, battery ageing, radiation effects, sensor noise, component degradation, and subsystem fault propagation.

### 4. Hardware-in-the-loop laboratory

Integrate single-board computers, microcontrollers, radios, sensors, hardware security modules, and simulated flight computers through safe, test-only interfaces.

### 5. Ground-station and CCSDS support

Add pass scheduling, antenna pointing, Doppler correction, packet framing, contact-plan optimisation, and standards-aligned telemetry structures without enabling uncontrolled transmission.

### 6. Production-grade durable orchestration

Add adapters for durable workflow systems, persistent task queues, distributed locks, workflow migration, long-running approvals, and independently validated compensation behaviour.

### 7. Stronger formal methods

Express critical properties with temporal logic, state-machine specifications, property-based testing, model checking, and machine-readable assurance cases.

### 8. Operational key management

Replace demonstration keys with hardware-backed or managed-key integrations, trusted timestamps, certificate rotation, revocation, threshold signing, and geographically separated approval identities.

### 9. Defensive cyber range

Create controlled attack-and-recovery scenarios covering replay, credential theft, malicious dependencies, compromised workers, policy outages, data poisoning, insider threats, and regional infrastructure compromise.

### 10. Real multi-region infrastructure

Validate routing, consistency, recovery, sovereignty, and cost models against disposable cloud or local-cluster deployments using real databases, queues, object stores, and observability systems.

### 11. Explainable mission intelligence

Add anomaly detection, energy forecasting, cloud prediction, pass-quality estimation, downlink optimisation, and target prioritisation with confidence, provenance, explainability, monitoring, and human override.

### 12. Advanced geospatial analytics

Add image registration, atmospheric correction, cloud masking, spectral indices, change detection, segmentation, flood-depth estimation, wildfire monitoring, and uncertainty visualisation.

### 13. Plug-in framework

Provide stable extension interfaces for orbit models, sensors, processors, policies, visualisations, storage systems, and data connectors.

### 14. Collaborative mission operations

Introduce role-specific operator workspaces, shared timelines, decision records, approval queues, incident rooms, and real-time status updates while preserving separation of duties.

### 15. Expanded education content

Create guided laboratories for orbital mechanics, spacecraft power, telemetry, geospatial analysis, APIs, zero trust, software supply chains, observability, distributed systems, and mission safety.

### 16. Independent benchmarking

Compare the project against reference datasets, public mission records, recognised algorithms, independently defined scenarios, and reproducible performance and accuracy benchmarks.

### 17. Operational-readiness roadmap

Develop requirements traceability, hazard analysis, threat modelling, configuration management, fault injection, reliability studies, independent verification and validation, operator training, and certification planning.

The priority for future development should be deeper realism, stronger verification, better interoperability, and reproducible evidence—not feature quantity alone.
